        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pour boiling water over oats in a large bowl. Add brown sugar, salt and oil. Cool to 110°-115°, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes. Add to oat mixture. Beat in enough flour to form a stiff dough (dough will be sticky).
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide and shape into 24 balls. Place in a greased 13x9-in. baking pan. Cover with a kitchen towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Preheat oven to 350°. Bake 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool. If desired, serve with butter and honey.
